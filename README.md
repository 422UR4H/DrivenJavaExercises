# Exercises from the Object-Orientation Acceleration with Java

Exercises made for the mini-course "Acceleration of Object Orientation with Java" taught by Driven post-formation.

<br />
Note 1: Sorry for English and Portuguese (Brazil) being mixed. I preferred to write in English, but I had to meet specific requirements in some exercises and, therefore, they are in Portuguese.

Note 2: as you can see in my pins, I already have good experience with Java Language (but not with the ecosystem) and the mini-course, in addition to guaranteeing a certificate that adds to my formation, also introduces us to Spring and Spring Boot, marking the beginning of my journey of learning this framework to return to my roots with Java and writing more secure and powerful, domain driven API backends!
